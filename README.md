Full-Stack Web App - Job Service
This project is a simple full-stack web app developed using Node.js, React.js (with TypeScript), and Ant Design UI library. It allows users to create jobs, view the list of jobs with a delayed response (between 5 seconds to 5 minutes).

Features
Display a list of jobs.
Create a new job.
Handle multiple pending jobs and unstable internet connections.

Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express
Frontend: React.js, TypeScript, Ant Design
Database: In-memory (for simplicity)
Authentication: None (optional to implement later)
Other Tools: Vite (for bundling and dev server)
